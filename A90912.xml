            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>COlonell <hi>John Poyer</hi> being ſentenced by the <hi>Court Marſhall</hi> at White-hall to ſuffet death (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his Lot for execution) implored the mercy of Parliament for his remiſſion, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe of his great and eminent ſervices former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done for this Common wealth, which he thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented and declared, <hi>viz.</hi> That he was one of the firſt that declared in Armes for the Parliament in Southwales, that he had took ſeverall ſhips bound for the relief of the Rebels in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that he had fortified
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:165054:3"/>many ſtrong Holds and Caſtles againſt the Common Enemy of this Nation, That he had furniſhed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in <hi>Dublin</hi> with great quantities of Corne and Victuals to the value of 500. <hi>l.</hi> whereof as yet he never received but 200. <hi>l.</hi> from the Parliament, That he had often engaged his life in many ſervices, to the great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of his perſon, and therefore humbly deſired, That for theſe, and many other publique Engagements, his life might be ſpared, the Sentence omitted, and that his bloud might not be violently ſpilt and caſt vpon the ground.</p>
            <p>But it could not be granted, the Lot falling ſo equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto him: So that according to the Sentence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt him, and for the putting the ſame into execution the time and place was appointed, and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he bee guarded to the <hi>Covent</hi> Garden neere Weſtminſter, on Wedneſday the 25. of <hi>Aprill,</hi> there to receive the diſmall tokens of Death, by the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of a Volley from a File of Muſqueriers.</p>
            <p>And to the end, that he might the better fit himſelfe for that great work, he was acquainted with the hour deſigned for his execution, who upon the delivery of that dreadfull meſſage, he ſeemed to give a favourable conſtructin in reference to his ſubmiſſion there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            </p>
            <p>He was very penitent, to his laſt hour, and uttered many condoling ſpeeches, in relation to the bleeding and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:165054:3"/>dying condition of this poor, ciſtreſſed &amp; languiſhing Nation, deſiring that his death might cloſe up the breach of the people, and that his bloud might bee the laſt that ſhould iſſue forth in ſtreames within the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels of this Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>And (according to the Sentence denounced againſt him) he was upon the 25 of this inſtant <hi>Aprill</hi> being Wedneſday, guarded from White-Hall in a Coach, to the place of execution, as aforeſaid, by Col. <hi>Hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Having ended his ſpeech, he went to prayers, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly riſing up again, called the men deſigned for his execution to him, which were ſix in number, and giving them the ſign when they ſhould give fire, which was by holding up both his hands, they obſerved his motion; who after ſome few expreſſions to his friends about him, prepared an embracement for death, and caſting his eyes to Heaven, with both hands lifted up, the Executioners (with their Fire locks) did their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice who at one voleybereav'd him of his life, his corp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THe Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> hath had ſeverall confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and diſputations with his grand Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours at the <hi>Hague;</hi> they preſſe hard for his going into <hi>Ireland,</hi> but he ſeemes very unwilling to give his aſſent thereto, and hath delivered ſeveral Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons at the Councell table (in the preſence of the Lord <hi>Cottington,</hi> and others) wherein he remonſtrates the apparent danger that may befall his Royall perſon, if once he ſhould ſet footing in that Kingdom, by reaſon of the falling off of his Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who are determined to act upon new principles, if once he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in the head of that Army.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, he was reſolved to make that place his chiefeſt Center for ſome certain time, having aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his affections either from <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> or <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> till he ſaw an opportunity, for the playing of his Game with more facility and ſurety.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Montroſse</hi> (during this reſpite of time) ſeriouſly minding the diſſenting expreſſions of the Prince, aroſe from the table, and with an auſteer countenance, ſaid, <hi>That if his Majeſty</hi> (for ſo is he called at the Court) <hi>would not hearken to the good Councell now attending his Royall perſon, in all probability, he might become the most deplorable Prince in Chriſtendome, and in ſtead of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the prerogative and felicity of three Kingdoms be forced to contain himſelfe within the bounds and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the Territories of one Naiton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prince replyed, That one Bird in the hand were better then two in the Buſh, and that one Crown firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and univerſally ſet upon his head, might produce greater tranquility and felicity to himſelf, and the reſt of the Royall Off ſpring, than three that ſhould ſtand in a tottering and unſtable motion, &amp;c: So that in all probability it is conjectured, that hee will decline his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:165054:4"/>Center both from <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and wholly caſt himſelf upon the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland;</hi> for hee hath declared, That he will caſt off the Earl of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſse,</hi> and all thoſe who are conceived Enemies to peace and truth, and apply himſelf to thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars propounded from the Eſtates of Scotland, which are conceived to be the voyce of the people, and the advice of that Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>He ſeemes to make little preparation againſt <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in reference to Warlike affaires, rather taking his late Fathers advice and admonition, to gain it by the way of reconciliation and treaty, then by the power of the bloud thirſty Sword.</p>
                  <p>But yet notwithſtanding he is much preſſed to the contrary, and the two Extraordinary Ambaſſadours from the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and the Queen of <hi>Sweth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> hath ſaluted his Highneſs, and at a conference con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doled the death of his late Father, intimating that they would uſe their utmoſt endeavours for the reinveſting of him in his juſt Rights and Dignities, and reſtoring of him to his Royall prerogative and Birth right; and to that end, have delivered their Repreſentation and Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the moſt high and mighty Lords, the States of the United Provinces, to joyne with them to aſſiſt, the ſaid King to obtain his Birthright; but it is ſaid they have declared their reſolution, to be offenſive nor defenſive againſt either parties: So that it is verily believed, that the States will act as Neutraliſts, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meddle with one ſide, nor the other. For they have declared, that nothing ſhall be wanting in them for the preſervation of a right underſtanding with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>England,</hi> and that they will endeavour the union and peace thereof againſt all oppoſition what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
